/**
 * A general interface describing a managed Device. A [Device] instance serves as a [CoroutineScope]
 * for all its internal operations. It also acts as a [Provider] for its children, properties, and actions,
 * enabling seamless integration with the DataForge ecosystem.
 *
 * The device's lifecycle is formally defined and managed by a Finite State Machine (FSM).
 * Commands to change the lifecycle state (e.g., start, stop) are sent as events to this FSM,
 * typically by a [space.kscience.controls.composite.old.contracts.CompositeDeviceHub]. The current state of the lifecycle is exposed reactively
 * via the [lifecycleState] property from the [ManagedComponent] interface.
 *
 * ### Communication Model: Hybrid RPC and Event Stream
 *
 * This interface employs a hybrid communication old that combines the simplicity of RPC-style method calls
 * with the observability of an event stream, aligning with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.
 *
 * - **Commands and Queries (RPC-style):** The methods `readProperty`, `writeProperty`, and `execute` define a clear,
 *   synchronous-looking (but asynchronous) contract for interactions. This provides a straightforward API for developers.
 *   **Important:** While these look like direct method calls, a compliant runtime
 *   **should** translate these calls into internal, serializable request messages. This ensures that in a
 *   distributed system, all interactions can be transmitted over a network and audited.
 *
 * - **Notifications (Event Stream):** The `messageFlow` property provides a one-way, hot [SharedFlow] of [DeviceMessage]s.
 *   This flow broadcasts asynchronous notifications about state changes, such as property updates, lifecycle events,
 *   and errors. It is not used for requests or direct command responses.
