/**
 * A base class for creating reusable, type-safe specifications for a device blueprint.
 * This class provides an object-oriented approach to defining the structure and behavior of a device.
 *
 * ### Key Concepts
 *
 * 1.  **Reusability:** By defining a device's properties, actions, and configuration in a class,
 *     you can easily reuse this specification across different parts of your application or in different projects.
 *
 * 2.  **Automatic Registration:** Properties, actions, and streams are declared as members using delegated properties
 *     (e.g., `val myProp by doubleProperty { ... }`). These delegates automatically register their
 *     corresponding specifications (`DevicePropertySpec`, `DeviceActionSpec`, etc.) with this `DeviceSpecification` instance
 *     at the moment of its creation.
 *
 * 3.  **Structured Configuration:** The abstract `configure()` method provides a dedicated scope
 *     ([CompositeSpecBuilder]) for defining non-delegated parts of the blueprint, such as the `driver`,
 *     `children`, and `lifecycle`. This separates concerns and makes the specification easier to read.
 *
 * 4.  **Visibility Control**: Use the `private { ... }`, `internal { ... }`, and `protected { ... }` scope functions
 *     to control the visibility of declared members, creating a clean public API for your blueprints.
 *
