/**
 * A port for continuous, low-latency, bidirectional streaming of binary data.
 * Unlike `Port`, which is designed for discrete byte array messages, `StreamPort` is optimized for
 * scenarios involving continuous data flow, such as video feeds, high-frequency sensor data,
 * or waveform transmission. It uses `kotlinx-io`'s [Buffer] to minimize data copying and improve performance.
 *
 * A `StreamPort` is a managed resource. The runtime is responsible for its entire lifecycle,
 * including calling [close] when the owning device is stopped or detached to ensure that
 * underlying resources like sockets or file handles are properly released. This contract is defined
 * in the `model` module because it is a fundamental part of a device's public-facing API,
 * similar to properties and actions.
 *
 * The [incoming] flow is expected to complete normally when the port is closed gracefully,
 * or fail with an exception (e.g., PortException) if an unrecoverable communication error occurs.
