/**
 * Defines a contract for migrating the state from an old device instance to a new one

 * its current state.
 *
 * @param Old The type of the old device from which the state is being migrated.
 * @param NewState The type of the state object, which must be [Meta]. This state will be
 *                 passed to the `restore()` method of the new device instance.
