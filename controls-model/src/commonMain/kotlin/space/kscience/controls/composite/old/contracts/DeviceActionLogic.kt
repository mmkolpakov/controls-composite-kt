/**
 * A contract for a reusable, standalone piece of business logic that can be executed as a device action.
 * This interface embodies the "Strategy" design pattern, allowing the logic of an action to be decoupled
 * from its declaration in a [DeviceBlueprint].
 *
 * Implementations of this interface can be versioned, independently tested, and reused across multiple
 * device blueprints, promoting modularity and reducing code duplication.
 *
 * The logic is [Named], allowing it to be organized hierarchically and discovered using DataForge's
 * standard provider mechanisms.
 *
 * @param D The type of the device on which this logic can operate. This is contravariant (`in`) to allow
 *          logic defined for a general device contract (e.g., `Device`) to be used on a more specific one.
 * @param I The input type for the action logic.
 * @param O The output type of the action logic.
