/**
 * A context for a single execution flow (a command plan or a query), carrying cross-cutting concerns
 * like security principal and tracing information.
 *
 * @param principal The identity of the caller. Defaults to a system principal.
 * @param correlationId A type-safe ID to trace a request through different components. Defaults to a random value.
 * @param originAddress The network address from which the original request was initiated. Can be null for internal requests.
 * @param fromCache Indicates that the primary result of this execution context was retrieved from a cache rather than being computed live.
 * @param traceContext An optional map containing trace propagation headers (e.g., W3C Trace Context).
 *                     This allows for seamless integration with distributed tracing systems like OpenTelemetry.
 *                     The runtime is responsible for propagating this context across network boundaries.
 * @param attributes Additional metadata for the execution context, for extensibility.
