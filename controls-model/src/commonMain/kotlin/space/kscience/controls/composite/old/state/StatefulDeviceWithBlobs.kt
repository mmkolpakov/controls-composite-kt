 * An extension of [space.kscience.controls.core.state.StatefulDevice] for devices that need to persist large binary data

 * well-suited for storage within a `Meta` object.
 *
 * The runtime persistence layer should check if a device implements this interface.
 * If it does, the runtime will call `snapshotBlobs` in addition to `snapshot` and
 * pass the results to a `SnapshotStore` that can handle binary data.
