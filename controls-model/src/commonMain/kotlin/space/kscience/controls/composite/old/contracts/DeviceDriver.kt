/**
 * A factory responsible for creating an instance of a device and managing its lifecycle via hooks.
 * The driver serves as the bridge between the abstract device old and the physical world (or a simulation).
 * It is a stateless, reusable component.
 *
 * The `DeviceDriver` contract has two primary responsibilities:
 * 1.  **Instantiation:** The [create] method acts as a factory for the device object itself.
 * 2.  **Lifecycle Management:** The `on...` hooks are called by the runtime at specific points in the
 *     device's lifecycle, allowing the driver to manage resources like hardware connections.
 *
 * **IMPORTANT:** The logic for a device's properties and actions is **not** defined here. It must be
 * provided in a `driverLogic { ... }` block within the `DeviceBlueprint`'s definition. This separation
 * ensures that the device's behavior is fully declared in the blueprint.
 *
 * @param D The type of the device contract this driver implements.
