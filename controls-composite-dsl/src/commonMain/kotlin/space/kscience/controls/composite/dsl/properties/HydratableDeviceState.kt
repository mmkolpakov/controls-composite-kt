 * An internal contract for a property delegate that can be "hydrated" by the runtime.
 * "Hydration" is the process of creating the actual, live [DeviceState] using the context
 * provided by a concrete device instance at runtime.
 *
 * This pattern decouples the DSL's declarative nature from the runtime's implementation details.
 * The DSL produces a `HydratableDeviceState`, and the `CompositeDevice` runtime is responsible for
 * calling [hydrate] to bring it to life.
